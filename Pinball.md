		- Why is this a feasible Idea?
		  collapsed:: true
			- It's a Windows game, so all you need is a computer to show a character playing this game
		- How can this be used as a metaphor?
		  collapsed:: true
			- Pinball has been into a long debate of whether it is a skill game or a chance game
			- While there are a lot of moments, you have shit under control, and you can just play around and score some points little mismatch in your timing, you lose, but sometimes nothing can save you
			- When the ball is in between both the flipper, no skill or timing is of any use
			- In the same way, life is a skill-based game until it's not
		- How can we make it look cool?
		  collapsed:: true
			- The projector ideas are super cool
			- We can do quick cuts of the flippers when the protagonist is struggling and trying hard in a situation, and the ball just falls in between the flipper when shit hits the fan, or the situation is out of their control
		- How can we make it sound cool?
		  collapsed:: true
			- We can use the game's music or produce something similar.
		- How can we use exposition to make the film witty? (People love hollow witty stuff. It's their masturbation, think Nolan and Fincher)

			- We can explain the idea of [Dominant Factor Test (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_Factor_Test) and maybe use it in the context of life if life is a skill-based game or a game of chance.

				  > Pinball machines were initially branded as games of chance in the 1940s as, after launching the ball, the player had no means to control its outcome.[10] Coupled with fears of pinball being a "tool of the devil" over the youth of that time, several jurisdictions labelled pinball as a game of chance and banned them from arcades. After the invention of the electric flipper in 1947, which gave the player more control over the ball's fate after launching, pinball manufacturers pushed to reclassify pinball as a game of skill. New York City's ban on pinball was overturned in 1976 when Roger Sharpe, a journalist, demonstrated the ability to call a shot to a specific lane to the city's council to prove pinball was a game of skill.[10]
