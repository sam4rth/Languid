	- Market size for modded **Android** apps? (**$24 Billion**)
	   
		- Estimating the market size for modded apps involves several factors, including user demand, app availability, and the potential revenue lost by official app developers. Here are some steps to make a reasonable estimation:
			- ### 1.  **Estimate User Base** :
			- Identify the number of users downloading modded apps.
			- Surveys and market research reports can help understand the percentage of Android users who use modded apps.
			- ### 2.  **Average Revenue per User (ARPU)** :
			- Calculate the ARPU for official apps in similar categories.
			- This can be found in app store statistics and industry reports.
			- ### 3.  **Revenue Loss to Modded Apps** :
			- Determine the percentage of users who would have paid for the official app if the modded version was not available.
			- Use historical data or studies on the impact of piracy on software sales.
			- ### 4.  **Multiplying Factors** :
			- Total market size for official apps.
			- The proportion of the market affected by modded apps.
			- #### Example Calculation:
			- **User Base Estimation**:
				- Total Android users globally: 2.5 billion.
				- Assume 5% use modded apps: 125 million users.
			- **Average Revenue per User**:
				- Assume ARPU for paid apps (games, utilities, etc.): $5/year.
			- **Revenue Loss**:
				- Assume 20% of modded app users would have paid for the official version: 25 million users.
				- Revenue loss per user: $5/year.
				- Total revenue loss: 25 million users * $5/year = $125 million/year.
			- **Market Size Estimation**:
				- If we assume modded apps capture around 20% of the potential revenue of the paid app market, and the global app market size is around $120 billion (as of recent estimates):
				- Modded app market size: 20% of $120 billion = $24 billion.
			- ### Summary:
			  
			  Based on these estimations, the market size for modded apps could be around **$24 billion annually**. This figure can vary significantly depending on user behaviour, regional differences, and the accuracy of the assumptions.

	- What could be the market for **IOS** if sideloading  is allowed?
	   
		- If sideloading were allowed on iOS, it could significantly impact the market, similar to the effects seen in the Android ecosystem. Here's a detailed estimation process:
		- ### 1.  **Estimate Potential User Base** :
			- Number of iOS users globally.
			- Proportion of users likely to engage in sideloading.
		- ### 2.  **Average Revenue per User (ARPU)** :
			- Current ARPU for iOS users.
			- Revenue loss due to sideloaded apps.
		- ### 3.  **Revenue Impact** :
			- Calculate potential revenue loss for official app developers.
			- Estimate the percentage of market capture by sideloaded apps.
		- ### 4.  **Multiplying Factors** :
			- Total market size for iOS apps.
			- Proportion of the market affected by sideloaded apps.
		- #### Example Calculation:
			- **User Base Estimation**:
				- Total iOS users globally: 1 billion.
				- Assume 5% would use sideloaded apps (based on similar Android sideloading behaviour): 50 million users.
			- **Average Revenue per User**:
				- Assume ARPU for iOS apps (including in-app purchases, subscriptions, etc.): $30/year.
			- **Revenue Loss**:
				- Assume 20% of sideloaded app users would have paid for the official version: 10 million users.
				- Revenue loss per user: $30/year.
				- Total revenue loss: 10 million users * $30/year = $300 million/year.
			- **Market Size Estimation**:
				- If we assume sideloaded apps capture around 20% of the potential revenue of the paid app market, and the global iOS app market size is around $85 billion (as of recent estimates):
				- Sideloaded app market size: 20% of $85 billion = $17 billion.
		- ### Summary:
		  
		  Based on these estimations, the market size for sideloaded apps on iOS could be around **$17 billion annually** if sideloading were permitted. This figure is subject to significant variation depending on user adoption rates, developer responses, and market dynamics.
